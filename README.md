### How to use

- Install node.js if not already installed on your machine
- ```git clone``` the repository
- Type ```npm install``` in the directory you cloned the project into to install dependencies.
- Type ```node init``` in the directory you cloned the project into to initialize any non-web-server needs (e.g. DB server), if an error occurs during this phase you don't have your database server configured correctly.
- Type ```npm start``` to start the web server
- Connect in browser through localhost:8080
